/// The periodic maintenance, with `workmanager`: Android's WorkManager and
/// iOS's BGTaskScheduler behind one API.
///
/// - **Android:** a periodic WorkManager job, about every 6 hours (the
///   system decides exactly: Doze and App Standby defer it), only while the
///   battery isn't low. It survives reboots and app updates.
/// - **iOS:** a `BGAppRefreshTask` with the identifier
///   [maintenanceTask], which `Info.plist` must permit
///   (`BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers`) and `AppDelegate` registers at
///   launch. iOS runs it when it sees fit, and less often for an app the
///   user rarely opens; 6 hours is only the earliest.
